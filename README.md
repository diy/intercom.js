### Cross-Window Message Broadcast Interface

Intercom is a client-side library that allows one window to broadcast messages to all other open windows / tabs (open to your site, of course). A [socket.io binding](#using-with-socketio) is built inâ€”which allows a single socket connection to painlessly propagate messages to all windows. Useful for chat services, notifications, and more.

The service is built on top of the [HTML5 localStorage API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-localstorage-attribute).

**Browser Support** ([chart](http://caniuse.com/#search=webstorage)):
IE8+, Firefox 3.6+, Chrome 4+, Safari 4+, Opera 10.5+

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// run this in multiple tabs!
var intercom = Intercom.getInstance();

intercom.on('notice', function(data) {
	console.log(data.message);
});

intercom.emit('notice', {message: 'Hello, all windows!'});
```

## Using with Socket.io

With the [socket.io](http://socket.io/) binding it's easy set up the socket connection to broadcast messages it receives to all open windows. It's also effortless to send messages over a single active socket from any open window (by calling `emit` on intercom).

```javascript
intercom.bind(socket);
```

If you wish to override the default behavior to control whether the socket should be treated as read-only or write-only, use:

```javascript
intercom.bind(socket, {
	send    : false, // send messages to the socket from intercom
	receive : true   // read messages from the socket and broadcast them over intercom
});
```

### Filtering Messages

There could be some cases where you want fine control over what is or isn't read from / sent to the socket. The `send` and `receive` options also accept callbacks that are invoked for each message to determine if it should be emitted. Returning `false` from either of these will cause the message to be ignored.

```javascript
intercom.bind(socket, {
	send: function(name, message) {
		return message.socket;
	},
	receive: function(name, message) {
		return message.broadcast;
	}
});
```

With the configuration above, messages like the following won't be sent to the socket:

```javascript
intercom.emit('notice', {
	socket: false,
	message: 'I won\'t be sent over the socket!'
});
```

Similarly, only messages coming from the socket that have `broadcast` set to true will be picked up by intercom.

### Uniqueness Constraints

In the case of multiple sockets in different windows possibly emitting the same message, use
the `id` option to ensure it's only acknowledged once by each window.

```javascript
intercom.bind(socket, {
	id: function(name, message) {
		return name + message.id;
	}
});
```

This requires you to send a unique identifier for each message from the socket.io source.

## Methods

### .bind(object, options)

Adds new binding.

### .emit(name, message, [id])

Broadcasts a message to all open windows (including the current window), with optional identifier.

### .off(name, fn)

Removes `fn` listener for messages with the given name.

### .on(name, fn)

Sets up a listener to be invoked when a message with the given name is received.

### .once(key, fn, [ttl])

Given a unique unique key to represent the function, `fn` will be invoked in only one window. The `ttl` argument represents the number of seconds before the function can be called again.

### .trigger(name)

Manually triggers callbacks for `name`, passing additional parameters as callback arguments.

### Intercom.destroy()

Removes all data associated with intercom from `localStorage`.

### Intercom.getInstance()

Returns an instance of Intercom. If one doesn't exist, it will be instantiated.
